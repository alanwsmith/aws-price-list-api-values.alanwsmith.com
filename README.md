# static-template.alanwsmith.com

My little template for when I make static sites without a framework

The site contents go in the `site` directory.

The basic `netlify.toml` script will point to that directory
when deployed.

## Features

- [x] OG Image call
- [x] Favicons
- [ ] Single HTML page with styles included
- [ ] HTML page that calls external CSS
- [ ] Basic CSS examples
